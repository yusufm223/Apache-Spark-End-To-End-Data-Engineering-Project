# Apache-Spark-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project

Explore IPL Dataset and learn about Apache Spark and different functions to transform the data.

Here are the things you will learn 
### ✅ Basics of Apache Spark (architecture, transformation, action, lazy evaluation)
### ✅ Creating a Databricks account and the basics of it
### ✅ Structured API and how to write transformation functions
### ✅ Using SQL to analyze IPL Data
### ✅ Building visualization to gain more insights 

The goal of this project is to give you an overall understanding of Apache Spark and its different functions to write transformation blocks on top of that you will learn SQL to analyze data and build visualization.
